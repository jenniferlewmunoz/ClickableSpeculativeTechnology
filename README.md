# Edible Food Packaging: Clickables Example
#### by Jennifer Lew Munoz


## Overview
This interactive web app allows you to see the different kinds of edible food packaging options to replace single use plastic food packaging. There are three major kinds of edible food packaging:

   - Liquid represented by the water droplet
   - Cold Foods represented by the snowflake
   - Hot Food represented by the thermometer

Depending on your choice between using edible food packaging vs single use plastic packaging the "Danger Meter" will increase or decrease. The danger meter represents the environmental dangers that comes with the amount of plastic littering our world.

## Example
Click the water droplet to choose between: an edible liquid pod, or a plastic water bottle. At the top of the program you will se the options "Edible Packaging" or "Plastic." If you choose "Plastic," the "Danger Meter" will increase, and if you choose "Edible Packaging," the "Danger Meter" will decrease.
